2. Open the terminal, navigate to the extracted folder, and run the following command: "./GNNSeqGUI"

3. If the app still doesn't run, open System Settings > Privacy & Security, and enable "Allow applications from: App Store and Known Developers" and click "Open anyway"

For Windows (may have issues running):

1. Extract the contents of the GNNSeqGUI.zip file.
   
2. Double-click the GNNSeqGUI.exe file to launch the application, or pen command prompt, navigate to the folder where GNNSeqGUI.exe is extracted, and run the following command: "GNNSeqGUI.exe"
   
3. If the app does not open, change the file extension to ".exe", and if still doesn't run, start the program in a 16-bit compiler.
