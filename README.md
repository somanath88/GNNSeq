# Downloading the GNNSeq Predictive Model
The executable file containing the GUI for the predictive GNNSeq model can be downloaded from the GNNSeqGUI zip files above. Please download either the GNNSeqGUI_Mac.zip or GNNSeqGUI_WIndows.zip respectively based on your system's OS. 

The executable file should be able to run without downloading any other dependencies. If any issues, kindly ensure that you run the application as an administrator. If your system blocks the application, verify and adjust your system permissions or manually bypass the operating system's security restrictions.

3. If the app does not open or if it is blocked by your system as potentially dangerous, please click "More information" and "Run anyway" in the pop-up. If it is still blocked, please go to your computer's system settings and allow "3rd party downloads from the internet".
